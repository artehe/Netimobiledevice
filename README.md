## Features

 - Backup an iOS device in the normal iTunes way or as customised as you like. 
 - Device discovery and connection via Usbmux.
 - Interact with iOS services
 - Handle all property lists files (.plist) whether they are in XML or Binary format

## Installation

To install Netimobiledevice, you can use the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```powershell
Install-Package Netimobiledevice
```

Alternatively, you can use the .NET CLI:

```csharp
dotnet add package Netimobiledevice
```

# Usage

A few examples of how to use Netimobiledevice are below.

Get a list of all currently connected devices using:

```csharp
using Netimobiledevice.Usbmuxd;

List<UsbmuxdDevice> devices = Usbmux.GetDeviceList();
Console.WriteLine($"There's {devices.Count} devices connected");
foreach (UsbmuxdDevice device in devices) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Device found: {device.DeviceId} - {device.Serial}");
}
```

Listen to connection events:

```csharp
Usbmux.Subscribe(SubscriptionCallback);

private static void SubscriptionCallback(UsbmuxdDevice device, UsbmuxdConnectionEventType connectionEvent)
{
    Console.WriteLine("NewCallbackExecuted");
    Console.WriteLine($"Connection event: {connectionEvent}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Device: {device.DeviceId} - {device.Serial}");
}
```

Get the app icon displayed on the home screen as a PNG:

```csharp
using (LockdownClient lockdown = LockdownClient.CreateLockdownClient("60653a518d33eb53b3ca2322de3f44e162a42069")) {
    SpringBoardServicesService springBoard = new SpringBoardServicesService(lockdown);
    PropertyNode png = springBoard.GetIconPNGData("net.whatsapp.WhatsApp");
}
```

Create an iTunes backup:

```csharp
using (LockdownClient lockdown = LockdownClient.CreateLockdownClient("60653a518d33eb53b3ca2322de3f44e162a42069")) {
    using (DeviceBackup backupJob = new DeviceBackup(lockdown, @"C:\Users\User\Downloads")) {
        backupJob.BeforeReceivingFile += BackupJob_BeforeReceivingFile;
        backupJob.Completed += BackupJob_Completed;
        backupJob.Error += BackupJob_Error;
        backupJob.FileReceived += BackupJob_FileReceived;
        backupJob.FileReceiving += BackupJob_FileReceiving;
        backupJob.FileTransferError += BackupJob_FileTransferError;
        backupJob.PasscodeRequiredForBackup += BackupJob_PasscodeRequiredForBackup;
        backupJob.Progress += BackupJob_Progress;
        backupJob.Status += BackupJob_Status;
        backupJob.Started += BackupJob_Started;

        await backupJob.Start();
    }
}
```

Pair an iOS device asyncronously:

```csharp
using (LockdownClient lockdown = LockdownClient.CreateLockdownClient(testDevice?.Serial ?? string.Empty)) {
    Progress<PairingState> progress = new();
    progress.ProgressChanged += Progress_ProgressChanged;
    await lockdown.PairAsync(progress);
}

private void Progress_ProgressChanged(object? sender, PairingState e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Pair Progress Changed: {e}");
}
```
